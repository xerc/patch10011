## Example
```
[ext("tt_news")]
  # Typoscript lines which will be active only if tt_news has been installed and loaded.
[end]
```
```
[ext("tt_news", "version") > "03.05.99"]
  # [..] only if tt_news in a version greater than 3.5.99 has been installed and loaded.
[end]
```

## Enhancement

Use the hook `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['patch10011']['userFunc']` in order to enhance this extension by any other TYPO3 extension which wants to provide its special userFunc to admins.

The old hook `$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['patch10011']['includeLibs']` has been removed.
